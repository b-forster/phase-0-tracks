Algorithm for using an elevator:

- Check which floor you’re on (= current_floor), and which floor you want to go to (=destination_floor).
 - If current_floor - destination_floor is a positive number, press the button going down.
 - If current_floor - destination_floor is a negative number, press the button going up. 
 - If current_floor - destination_floor is zero, then you’re already on the right floor. Do not use the elevator.
- Move 1 meter back and stand facing the door.
- When the doors open, check if there is room for you in the elevator. 
 - If there is no room, wait until the elevator has started moving and press the same up or down button as before. Repeat this step until the elevator has room.
 - When there is enough room, enter the elevator.
- Check to see if there is another human or robot in front of the floor button panel.
 - If someone is there, tell them your destination floor.
 - If no one is there, move to the button panel, face toward it, and enter the number corresponding to destination_floor.
- When the elevator stops, check if the new current_floor = destination_floor.
 - If they are not equal, wait and repeat this step.
 - If they are equal, exit the elevator.


Algorithm for when the alarm rings:

- Is it a weekend or holiday?
 - If yes, is your calendar clear for the next two hours?
   - If yes, turn off the alarm and go back to sleep.
   - If no, turn off the alarm and wake up.
 - If no, are you feeling sick today?
  - If yes, turn off the alarm and call in sick to work.
  - If no, turn off the alarm and wake up.
