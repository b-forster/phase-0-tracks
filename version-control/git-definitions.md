# Git Definitions!!!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows users to make separate edits locally to a single file, and then merge those changes back into the original file.This saves the trouble of merging everyone's changes by hand, and it prevents developers from accidentally overwriting each other's changes
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the repository that developers can use to test out new features before merging them back into the master repository.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit writes the local modifications to the remote file. Commit messages should describe the change that was made specifically. For some reason they should also be written in present tense.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when a user tries to commit a local modification which is inconsistent with a remote modification.
