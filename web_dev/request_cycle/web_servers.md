* What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Speed, efficiency, and standardization.

* In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a dedicated space on a remote server which a user can purchase and run an OS on. A VPS is cost effective, scalable, and allows root access.

* Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

If you run a program as the root user, you are able to make administrative-level changes without providing login credentials, and you may not be able to undo these changes in the event of of a mistake. It also is easier to hack than another user account because the attacker does not need to guess the user name.
