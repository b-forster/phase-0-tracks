	Q: What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	A: The semantic tags give context to the elements on your page, which makes the code easier to read. They also improve the accessibility of your page for people using screen readers. I think the most useful ones are the ones that show how the page is structured, like <aside> and <nav>.

	Q: What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	A: First it determines the layout, and then renders each element in the display.

	Q: What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	A: I learned how to create a snippet, which is a code template that can be called up with a single word. This looks like a huge time saver and something that will definitely come in handy in the future.

	Q: What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	A: The usage of some of the semantic tags was sometimes hard to understand until we played around with them. For example, we learned through trial and error that an <aside> tag cannot be nested inside of a <main> element, and a table cannot be used inside of an <article> element, or else the parent elements will automatically be considered closed at that point. I have already googled these tags to learn more about their usage, but I think most of my learning will come through trial and error.
