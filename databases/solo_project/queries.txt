1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM students;

1|Brianna Forster|3|3.45
2|Leonardo da Vinci|1|2.3
3|Albert Einstein|4|3.14
4|Maya Angelou|3|3.7


2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE students set gpa = 2.6 WHERE name = "Leonardo da Vinci";


3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT * FROM students, departments WHERE students.department = departments.id;

1|Brianna Forster|3|3.45|3|Humanities
2|Leonardo da Vinci|1|2.3|1|Art
3|Albert Einstein|4|3.14|4|Sciences
4|Maya Angelou|3|3.7|3|Humanities


4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT students.name, departments.dept_name FROM students JOIN departments ON students.department = departments.id;

Brianna Forster|Humanities
Leonardo da Vinci|Art
Albert Einstein|Sciences
Maya Angelou|Humanities


5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM students WHERE name="Albert Einstein";



RELEASE 3 - Joins

1.
SELECT name, gpa FROM students NATURAL JOIN departments;

Brianna Forster|3
Leonardo da Vinci|1
Maya Angelou|3

(*No matching column names, so nothing was joined)

2.
SELECT name, department FROM students LEFT JOIN departments USING (department);

Error: cannot join using column department - column not present in both tables
