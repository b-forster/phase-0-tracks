- You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?


SELECT reviews.id, users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
INNER JOIN users
ON reviews.user_id = users.id
INNER JOIN businesses
ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;


1|Steven|Wonder|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|A uniquely transformative experience
2|Mandy|Kaling|The Beagle Nightclub|2|You get what you pay for
3|Angelina|Jolie|Amir's Towing|4|Reliable and flexible
4|Bradford|Pitt|Lotus Yoga|1|I still haven't been able to de-pretzel myself




- There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
INNER JOIN users
ON reviews.user_id = users.id
INNER JOIN businesses
ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

- How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
FROM reviews
INNER JOIN users
ON reviews.user_id = users.id
INNER JOIN businesses
ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
WHERE businesses.name = "The Beagle Nightclub";
